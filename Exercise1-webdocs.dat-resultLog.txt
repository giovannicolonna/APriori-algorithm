STEP 1: original threshold t * p

[Randomized apriori] 21 frequent itemsets of size: 1
[Randomized apriori] 55 frequent itemsets of size: 2
[Randomized apriori] 60 frequent itemsets of size: 3
[Randomized apriori] 28 frequent itemsets of size: 4
[Randomized apriori] 5 frequent itemsets of size: 5
[Randomized apriori] 0 frequent itemsets of size: 6


False-positives elimination:
Apriori randomized without FP contains: 149 elements:
[Randomized apriori without FP] 19 elements of size: 1
[Randomized apriori without FP] 50 elements of size: 2
[Randomized apriori without FP] 53 elements of size: 3
[Randomized apriori without FP] 26 elements of size: 4
[Randomized apriori without FP] 1 elements of size: 5
37 false negatives have been detected.

Total time elapsed, randomized a-priori (with false positive elimination): 217.283941031

STEP 2: false negatives reduction, 0.9 * p * t
